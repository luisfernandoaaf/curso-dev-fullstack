            Hey! I'm <strong>Swift</strong>, a guy who's thinking about being a <strong>R6 mobile pro player</strong>, but I don't know if it's a profession that I would like to do more than to be a <b>programmer</b>, but it's something that I would like to at least <i>try</i> and see by myself how it looks like <em>to be a pro.</em>
        </p>

        <h3>Main skills</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lot of knowledge about R6;</li>
            <li>Dedication;</li>
            <li>A willing to win.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other Stuff I like to do</h3>

        <p>
            Play R6 mobile, Read Manhwa(I'm reading Jungle Juice, the manhwa I read before JJ was Legend of the Northern Blade, also an amazing one), listen to a good song (lately I've been listening to Black Marble - Feels, Musedash songs like: Wonderful Pain, Tetracalyx - Breaking Down).
